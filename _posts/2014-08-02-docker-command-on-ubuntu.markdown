I've seen some people ask about making the [Docker][docker] command
`docker.io` on Ubuntu work like it does in the examples: `docker`.  I
found this inconvenient too, but fortunately, Ubuntu and Debian have
had a solution to this for a long time, it's called
[alternatives][alternatives].  In
this particular case, there is already an Ubuntu package called `docker`
which is why they are trying to de-conflict executable names by using
`docker.io` in the first place.  Ironically, the original `docker`
package doesn't even contain an executable named `docker`.  Or at least
it doesn't as of Ubuntu 14.04.

{% highlight bash %}
$ dpkg -L docker
/.
/usr
/usr/share
/usr/share/menu
/usr/share/menu/docker
/usr/share/doc
/usr/share/doc/docker
/usr/share/doc/docker/changelog.Debian.gz
/usr/share/doc/docker/README
/usr/share/doc/docker/copyright
/usr/share/man
/usr/share/man/man1
/usr/share/man/man1/wmdocker.1.gz
/usr/bin
/usr/bin/wmdocker
{% endhighlight %}

I don't fully understand the Ubuntu/Debian policies on package and
executable naming, but perhaps the use of `docker.io` is unnecessary.
Regardless, those of us who aren't concerned with building packages can
either simply soft link the `docker.io` command to `docker` or create
an alternative:

{% highlight bash %}
# Making a link
sudo ln /usr/bin/docker.io /usr/bin/docker
# Using Alternatives
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/docker docker \
  /usr/bin/docker.io 1
{% endhighlight %}
