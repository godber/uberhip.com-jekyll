At the November 2014 [DesertPy](http://desertpy.com) meeting I learned
about [ANTLR the parser generator](http://www.antlr.org/) and thought 
that would be the proper way to approach writing a parser for the labels
of NASA's PDS3 file format.  I spent some time and read <a

Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference</a><img

grammar that works fairly well at this point.

The ANTLR grammar and corresponding generated Python parser are Open
Source, BSD Licensed and are available on GitHub:

* [ANTLR Grammar](https://github.com/godber/pds3_grammar/)
* [Generated Python Parser v0.9.0](https://github.com/godber/pds3_grammar/releases/download/v0.9.0/pds3_python-v0.9.0.tar.gz)

If you are interested in using this, I'd love help coming up with more
sample PDS label snippets to make sure everything is working.  Check out
the [data](https://github.com/godber/pds3_grammar/tree/master/antlr_grammar/data)
directory that contains my sample PDS labels to see what I've missed.  Also note
that there is one [known bug](https://github.com/godber/pds3_grammar/issues/2)
in the grammar related to handling strings.

Right now, there is no usable application code other than the parser
generated by ANTLR.  I am starting the Python application level code now
and hopeful to get something working soon.

PS - Many thanks to [Ian](https://ianpreston.io/) for giving that [ANTLR
presentation](https://ianpreston.io/talks/a4talk/#/).
