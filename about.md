Welcome to my website. My name is Austin Godber. I have a bachelors in
[Physics](http://phy.asu.edu/) from [Arizona State
University](http://www.asu.edu/). I am a Software Engineer and Linux
Administrator. I have worked on DARPA sponsored computer security projects,
helped start a Municipal WiFi company, assisted NASA's [Mars Spaceflight
Facility](http://www.mars.asu.edu/) in surviving the Slashdot effect, wrangled
virtual penguins for [JumpBox](http://www.jumpbox.com/), operated cameras on
NASA's MER and MSL Mars rovers and now develop and manage petabyte scale
distributed systems for [Terascope](http://www.terascope.io).
